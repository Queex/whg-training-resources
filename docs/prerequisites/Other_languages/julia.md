# Julia

Julia is an interesting language that is pretty good for many data analysis and computational
tasks. Like python it has a rich ecosystem of data analysis packages but it has a few features that
make it different from others

- like C++ it is strongly typed and compiled.  It's easier to avoid paying a performance cost than in python or R.
- Nevertheless it acts much like an interpreted language, like Python or R.
- It also has an interesting approach based on *multiple dispatch* (different, say, from object-oriented languages like python)

Installing julia is easy using conda:
```
mamba install -c conda-forge julia
```
