# Getting your environment setup

The tutorials found here involve running bioinformatics tools and writing computer code. You will
need an appropriate setup to run them - including:

* A computer.
* Some software.
* Some basic coding skills.

A computing environment for science is a dynamic thing, but these pages will outline how to set up
a basic environment suitable for running the tutorials. Follow them if you don't know where to
start.
