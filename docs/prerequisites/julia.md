# Installing Julia

We've got [R](./R.md) and [python](python.md) - how about [julia](https://julialang.org)? Julia is
a relatively new language that has an interesting feature set that sits somewhere between python
and compiled languages like C++.  I've used it for a few projects and found it pretty good.

Installation is easy - you can:

* For **Mac OS**, download the relevant package [from the download
page](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and install it.

* For **Linux**, download the relevant package [from the download
  page](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and place it in a directory somewhere, use `apt-get
  julia` (on Ubuntu) to install it, or use the conda to install it:

* For Windows, if you want to work with julia in the UNIX terminal, install the linux version as
  above.
