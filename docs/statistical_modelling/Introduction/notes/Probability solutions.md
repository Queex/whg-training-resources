## Probability warm-up questions

**Question**.  Suppose there is 30% chance of recombination between two genetic variants on a chromosome. What is
the chance that two siblings will inherit the same copy of the variants (and the whole segment
in between) from their mother?

**Answer**.  Call the inherited segments A and B.  Then

P( A = B ) = P( v1(A) = v1(B) AND no recombination )
= P( v1(A) = v1(B) ) \times P( no recombination )
